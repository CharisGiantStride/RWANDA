                     <h2>Exploration Of Economy</h2>
              <p>Kigali is the economic and financial hub of Rwanda, serving as the country's
                  main port of entry and largest business centre.
                  The NISR does not maintain detailed economic data for subnational entities in Rwanda,
                  but economists have used various measures to estimate the city's output.
                  A 2015 working paper by the World Bank Policy Research unit used the amount of light
                  visible at night in different regions as a proxy for relative gross domestic product (GDP),
                  and found that the three districts of Kigali represented 42 per cent of Rwanda's total night-light
                  output.When translated, this gives a total city GDP of approximately
                  US$1.8 billion or $1,619 per capita, compared with a national average
                  of $436 per capita.
                  Another 2015 World Bank study measured the total turnover of registered companies
                  in the country, as reported to the Rwanda Revenue Authority,
                  found that 92 per cent of these were from the city of Kigali.
                  However, the authors noted that this figure excluded turnover
                  from small-scale farming, and was also inflated for companies
                  headquartered in Kigali with revenue generated elsewhere in Rwanda.
                  Official statistics classify economic activity as either "farm" or "non-farm",
                  and Kigali accounts for 39 per cent of non-farm waged employees in the country.</p>

                    <h2>Cultural Diversity</h2>
              <p>Kigali was not historically the hub of Rwanda's cultural heritage. For example, the country's
                  traditional dance, a choreographed routine consisting of three components,
                  originated in the royal court at Nyanza.[161] However, the capital is now home to many
                  groups which perform the dance including the LEAF community arts troupe,[162] whose founding
                  members were eighteen homeless orphaned children,[163] and Indatirwabahizi, a cultural troupe
                  affiliated with the city government.[164] Drums are of great importance in traditional Rwandan
                  music; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the mwami. Drummers play together
                  in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number.[165] Traditional music and songs
                  are performed in venues across the city by acts such as the Gakondo Group led by Massamba
                  Intore.[166] Rwanda and Kigali have a growing popular music industry, influenced by African
                  Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music. The most popular genre is hip hop, with a blend o
                  f dancehall, rap, ragga, R&B and dance-pop. Since 2011, the Kigali Up music festival
                  has been held annually in July or August.Artists from Rwanda and other countries
                  perform music in a variety of styles including reggae and blues, with audiences of several
                  thousand. Some of the musicians also give lessons to attendees during the festival.
                  The Hobe Rwanda Festival, held in September, features music as well as dance and local art.</p>

                     <h2>Education</h2>
              In colonial and pre-genocide Rwanda, Butare was the country's principal centre for tertiary education. Early colleges such as the Nyakibanda Major Seminary, founded in 1936, and three 1960s establishments including the National University of Rwanda (UNR), were all located in the southern city.[183][184][185] The first higher-education institution in Kigali was the Institut Africain et Mauricien de statistique et d'économie appliquée, which was founded in 1976,[183][186] but the city did not become a major centre of learning until the second half of the 1990s. At that time, the public Kigali Health Institute (KHI), Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) were founded, along with private universities the Kigali Independent University (ULK) and the University of Lay Adventists of Kigali (UNILAK).[183] Further institutions were added in Kigali in the 21st century, including the public School of Finance and Banking (SFB) in Gikondo and the private University of Kigali,[187] as well as branches of foreign universities such as Mount Kenya University and Carnegie Mellon University's college of engineering.[188][189][190] As of 2018, there were a total of 50,594 students enrolled at tertiary institutions in Kigali, with a total of 28 separate campuses.[191]
